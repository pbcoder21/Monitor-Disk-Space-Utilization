# Monitor-Disk-Space-Utilization

Monitor disk space utilization on Linux systems using Shell scripting and automate the process of sending email alerts when disk space crosses predefined thresholds. When disk space reaches critically low levels, it can lead to system crashes, data corruption, and other serious issues. Therefore, implementing a proactive approach to monitor disk space and receive alerts when thresholds are exceeded is essential for maintaining system reliability and availability.
